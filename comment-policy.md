# Comment Policy

## Policy summary: Stay on topic. Be dignified. Keep it friendly. No advertising.

This blog is a collection of my thoughts, views and activities related to computer science. The aim is to have **anyone** interested to be able to participate in an appropriate manner. Religion, ethnicity, gender and sexual identity, level of experience, disability and age are not to be barriers here. The topics of interest are the topics of interest, so let's stick to them and get along with each other.

Zsuark's blogsite goal is to have a supportive and affirming environment focused on software engineering, computer science and mathematics. By commenting you are choosing to put aside any other agenda other than your interest in the presented topic. You agree to speak with polite respect.

My views are my own, I do not necessarily expect you to agree with them. If you disagree with something I or someone else has written, do not say that I am/they are wrong - demonstrate your understanding in a polite and dignified way. Try out the ideas presented before challenging them, share what you see and understand. Show your code and maths.

Many of us think and feel differently. Let's be dignified for ourselves by being respectful, friendly and encouraging. Be curious about what others are doing, rather than critical of their differences. If you can't say anything nice, it is better to not say anything at all. Think before you speak.

Zsuark's blogsite was not created to directly earn money from advertising or sales. Please do not directly advertise or promote here. If you make reference to a resource on another site, that is fine - and the higher the quality and greater the pertinency the better. Otherwise, promoting another site is not cool. References to web resources on free-to-access sites are recommended. If I do mention books or other copyrighted non-free material, I do not earn a commission or other financial incentive to mention them. The same stipulation is expected of anyone making comments on the blog.


## Example appropriate behaviour

- Polite, clean, respectful language

## Example inappropriate behaviour

- Personal attacks or criticism, xenophobic comments, disparaging or belittling others
