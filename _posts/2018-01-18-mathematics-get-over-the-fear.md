# Mathematics &mdash; it is time to get over the fear!

## Dedication

Before I launch into this, I'd like to take a moment to dedicate this post to my year 11 and 12 high school maths teacher, Christine Joan Elder (1949 - 2016). I was saddened to learn very recently that she passed away a little over a year ago due to cancer. 

She was a wonderfully intelligent, compassionate and hard-working woman. Whilst preparing this post on maths and computer science I had been thinking fondly of her and what she taught me has been coming back as if it was yesterday. She gave me the confidence and skills to persue my current carrer. It was a shock to discover she had died relatively recently, and I feel a great sense of loss that I never got to see her again and I cannot tell her how much I appreciated her personally.

Mrs Elder could explain mind-bending-and-melting topics clearly when teaching students of different abilities and needs, never skipping a beat. She did her best to ensure all her students' needs were accommodated, and never made you feel stupid if you made a mistake, however silly it may have been. Mrs Elder just loved the maths and teaching. She cared greatly for her students.

In her private family life, she had the great task of caring for her children - including sons with cystic fibrosis. She saved the life of one of her sons by donating organs to him whilst she was alive. Mrs Elder was a true hero.

I was a bit of a different teen and my high school years were very confusing, alienating and depressing. My 3 unit maths classes (the highest level my school offered) were a safe-haven where I could be myself whilst working out my brain. Maths and Mrs Elder never judged **me** negatively on any basis. She always focussed on bringing out the best of my ability &mdash; not my short-comings. It was the first time I really enjoyed mathematics classes in school, and I felt valued in them.

Mrs Elder strongly encouraged my abstract reasoning skills and understanding of mathematical processes. She was something extra special compared to any other teacher I have ever had &mdash; an amazing example of a wonderfully intelligent, capable and compassionate human being. I will be forever in her debt. If I had more teachers like Mrs Elder from an earlier age, my experience of the childhood education system would have been radically different for the better.

Thank you Mrs Elder for helping me have the rewarding and exciting career and persuits I have today. You are sorely missed.


# Mathematics &mdash; it is time to get over the fear!

## Mathematics is scary, isn't it?

It seems that the word "maths" induces fear into many people, and certainly IT professionals are not immune. If like me, at least in the past, the word maths strikes fear in you instilled from childhood education of arithmetic. I hope that you will let mathematics, and yourself, off the hook.

...and yes, I contract mathematics to "maths" not "math". Deal with it. &#128540;


## But everyone knows maths is difficult!

Take for example Ed Finkler's talk "[Graph Databases Will Change Your Freakin' Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vleFxDGoEs)". Quote: "Math -- it's hard, let's skip it"

However, there's a white lie here. All databases are mathematical abstractions. Ed actually goes on to do an excellent job of clearly explaining the high level abstractions used in Graph databases. Ed is actually explaining the maths in terms you understand. So, when he says "let's skip it" &mdash; it is a white lie designed to calm us.

"It uses math and stuff I don't understand but it works! It is pretty cool!" ([Ed's talk around 15:00 mark](https://youtu.be/3vleFxDGoEs?t=15m)).

The truth of the matter, that despite our hang-ups, is that we use maths every day &mdash; often when we think we are not. To be better IT professionals, we need to embrace maths more. Forget being afraid of mysterious and unknown symbols - they make sense when you've been trained in them, but the underlying concepts you probably already know or are learning more naturally.

Don't forget that the job of a good education is to ease the process of learning. It is far more difficult to make mathematical discoveries and proofs than what it is to learn someone else's hard work. Many articles of maths already seem easy to us, but millenia of human history have gone into them. YouTuber [Sen Zen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8WtjEDy5SLJnnnY4R-LrtA) has a nice discussion on this in his video "[So You Think 2x - 4 = 12 is Easy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OehlUOx8xf8)" - he does go into algebra a little, but I hope you are getting the message I'm sending you. Don't be scared when you first see a new concept and it seems hard. Relax and practice. You'll get there, and future you will find it simpler and thank you.

Whilst I greatly respect Ed Finkler, I do not like that he seems to suggest that the underlying maths is overly difficult and that you shouldn't have to worry about it too much. It does the audience a disservice.

Regardless of our understanding of it, maths works. Understanding comes with time. If you know the maths well enough to use it, you already have a good base understanding.

Further, maths is not all numerical and obsessed with arithmetic. Abstraction, algorithms, set theory, graph theory, logic and more are all mathematics that you find in computer science and you use almost all of them already. So the good news is, you are already using it and are better than you think.


# Mathematics and Computer Science

[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), as of time of writing:

"Mathematics (from Greek μάθημα máthēma, "knowledge, study, learning") is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.

"Mathematicians seek out patterns and use them to formulate new conjectures. Mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist..."

[Edsger Djikstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) was intrigued with computer programs and mathematical proof, and saw [programming as a discipline of mathematical nature](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD361.html).

Who are we to disagree! The man has a point. Computer programming focuses on symbolic representation of abstract concepts (and abstractions of the concrete) &mdash; just as mathematics does. The same core topics computer science deals with &mdash; such as "quantity, structure, space, and change" &mdash; are the same topics mathematics already deals with.

Edsger also advocated and named "Structured programming" &mdash; a paradigm that is ubiquitous to (many of) us now. He had a lot of interesting ideas and ways of thinking about information, and was a massive influence on modern computer science. I could argue he was one of the first Agile practitioners. Either way, "[No other individual has had a larger influence on research in principles of distributed computing](http://www.podc.org/dijkstra/)".


## Learn the abstraction, before the implementation

One of benefits of tertiary maths and computer science education is learning the abstractions outside of their implementations in any particular language or technology. To be creative in computer science, this approach is vital! See [National Geographics' article on this](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2008/04/24/when-learning-maths-abstract-symbols-work-better-than-real-world-examples/).

If you only learn mathematical concepts within a single technology implementation &mdash; you are doing yourself an injustice. The above article makes me wonder if this is why the recently super popular code "bootcamps" are now failing and frequently closing down.

In other words, if you want to learn to program (or other tech skill) quickly, and then to be able to apply those skills in real life situations, do not focus solely on the software language, learn the underlying mathematical abstractions. Learn about sets and set theory. Learn about general operating system concepts before or alongside your favourite operating system. Learn about trees, data structures, loops, conditionals and the computer science fundamentals before you insist that your chosen programming language is the biggest and the best and no other language is ever needed. Learn the maths and gain a greater understanding of the languages you learn, their strengths and weaknesses.


# Enjoy your voyage of discovery

When it boils down to it, if you enjoy computer science &mdash; be it software development, systems management or just knowing how things work &mdash; then you like mathematics.

My tips:
- Embrace maths, look at it with fresh eyes and enjoy the process of learning
- Let your curiosity overcome fear and pain
- Discover and reinvent for yourself the maths used
- Use pen/pencil and paper and map out the underlying process (like our friend Edsger recommends)
- Think about the problems and play with them as much, if not more, than sitting and writing code
- Schedule and plan your work so you have enough time for everything
- Take regular and frequent breaks, even in your busiest times
- Invest in yourself and your work with enjoyable study
- Relax, life isn't supposed to be about stress
- ENJOY it!

It's important to be relaxed and well rested. To go fast, sometimes we need to slow down. This is a core concept in Rich Hickey's talk on [Hammock Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc). We sometimes trip over our own feet rushing to get things done. Plan your day so you have enough time for everything.

It is surprising how easy deadlines are to meet, when you relax and stop constantly rushing to meet them. This is not to say that there won't be extremely busy and long days, but you'll have far fewer of them and will be able to enjoy your career more whilst being more productive.


# Summary

- Don't be afraid of maths
- It is not as hard to use and comprehend as you may believe
- Maths is broader than you think
- Relax, schedule, take your time, and enjoy the process

That's it folks... See you next week if not before. Don't be afraid to comment!
