## A structured programming approach

I find it strange that people get very upset about precisely adhering to a standard with software diagram modelling techniqes.

Diagram models are just that - the purpose of them is to clearly communicate the ideas and processes they represent. How well those ideas and processes are communicated should determine the level of correctness, rather than strict conformation to a standard. This is not to say that standards don't have their place &mdash; but ask yourself what is most important for the context.
