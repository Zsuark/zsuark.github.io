# Mathematics! Argh!
## ...but it's time to get over the fear


## Mathematics is scary, isn't it?

It seems that the word "maths" induces fear into most people, and certainly IT professionals are not immune. If like me, at least in the past, your default reaction to the word maths strikes you fear instilled from childhood education. I hope that you will let mathematics, and yourself, off the hook.


## But everyone knows maths is difficult!

Take for example Ed Finkler's talk "[Graph Databases Will Change Your Freakin' Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vleFxDGoEs)". Quote: "Math -- it's hard, let's skip it"

However, there's a white lie here. All databases are mathematical abstractions. Ed actually goes on to do an excellent job of clearly explaining the high level abstractions used in Graph databases. Ed is actually explaining the maths in terms you understand. So, when he says "let's skip it" &mdash; it is a white lie designed to calm us.

It is helpful to remember that maths is not always what we expect it to be. [Relax - you're soaking in it!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eIRksrDBXM)  _(N.B. dishwashing liquid is __not__ good for your skin, unlike maths which is good for your mind.)_

...and yes, I contract mathematics to "maths" not "math". Deal with it. &#128540;

The truth of the matter, that despite our hang-ups, is that we use maths every day - often when we think we are not. To be better IT professionals, we need to embrace maths more. Forget being afraid of mysterious and unknown symbols - they make sense when you've been trained in them, but the underlying concepts you probably already know or are learning more naturally.


## Don't Panic!

"It uses math and stuff I don't understand but it works! It is pretty cool!" ([Ed's talk around 15:00 mark](https://youtu.be/3vleFxDGoEs?t=15m)).

Regardless of our understanding of it, maths works. Understanding comes with time. If you know the maths well enough to use it, you already have a good base understanding.

Further, maths is not all numerical and obsessed with arithmetic. Abstraction, algorithms, set theory, graph theory, logic and more are all mathematics that you find in computer science and you use almost all of them already. So the good news is, you are already using it.


## You're soaking in it!

[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), as of time of writing:

"Mathematics (from Greek μάθημα máthēma, "knowledge, study, learning") is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.

"Mathematicians seek out patterns and use them to formulate new conjectures. Mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist..."

[Edsger Djikstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) was intrigued with computer programs and mathematical proof, and saw [programming as a discipline of mathematical nature](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD361.html). (He is also advocated and named "Structured programming" - a paradigm that is ubiquitous to us now. He had a lot of interesting ideas and ways of thinking about information, and was a big influence on modern computer science.)

Who are we to disagree! The man has a point. Computer programming focuses on symbolic representation of abstract concepts (or abstractions of concrete concepts) - just as mathematics does.

The same core topics computer science deals with &mdash; such as "quantity, structure, space, and change" &mdash; are the same topics mathematics already deals with.


## Borrow other people's smarts

The issues we face in designing systems and software to fulfill demands may be expressed mathematically. As such, we have many mathematical rules, operations and proofs already available to us. A little bit of study can help us from having to reinvent the wheel.

Studying mathematics gives us a greater understanding of the problems we face and provides pre-existing solutions and/or methodologies to find them. It extends our language of the problem domain and gives us already well worked answers.

So, be a little lazy and take a little time to look at what solutions and ways of reasoning about a problem mathematics brings.


## Enjoy discovery

When it boils down to it, if you enjoy computer science &mdash; be it software development, systems management or just knowing how things work &mdash; then you like mathematics.

- embrace it
- curiosity beats fear and pain
- reinvent for yourself
- use pen/pencil and paper
- think as much, if not more, than you do.
