# Summary of past week



Jake came up with an idea of an application mixing two different statistics

So, a lot has been happening in my personal life lately, and I moved house recently, which is why I have not been blogging as frequently. I am still exceeding my stated goal. I will need to pay attention as to not to fall out of pattern too much.

TODO: CBT of above

Update: Confronted by guest. Pattern thrown out. Avoidance behaviours.

Why: Not sure what to do next. ..but my head knows to do what I know to do and figure the rest out as needed, until a more consistent routine appears.

Current need:

- Java skills
- Design patterns
- collate / write out work experiences

Goal:
- Succesful job interviews for appropriate work

Tasks:
- Follow up further with Matej
- Write out 5 design patterns
- Write out 5 anti-patterns
- Study Google AdWords API
- Study (brand Jake mentioned) API
- write 1 (of 3+) job examples of good work
