# ~~Views~~ Rant on software development and employment in the IT sector

## Object Oriented Programming

As an IT professional, I often feel market demand is pushed by vendor demand. When Microsoft released Visual C++ in 1993, and then Sun Microsystem released Java in 1995, "OOP" was the buzzword. "Code reuse" was another clich√© bantered around. Everyone cool was on the OOP bandwagon. Anyone with differing thoughts, must have been crazy - except operating systems and games programmers, they had a point - and time would tell.

Time has told. Almost everyone is taught OOP by default today, often with a particular focus on dynamic programming. Everywhere you look, Object Oriented programming and design are expected of software developers. It is now apparent that code reuse is determined by the problem, need and style choices regardless of language and paradigm. This is not to say OOP is bad - far from it - but why are we all doing it, and for what benefit?

Unfortunately or fortunately, POV dependant, Object Oriented Programming has never been overly well defined. Whilst it is true that some have tried to stress certain aspects as crucial or "pure" - things like data encapsulation and hiding, inheritence, polymorphism, etc are touted as being necessary. However, in practice we find the common factor behind all OO labelled languages is that it has objects with data and functions (methods) bound together.
