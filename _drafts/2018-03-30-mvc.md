# Model View Controller

The Model View Controller (or MVC) design pattern is very frequently used for user interactions, and there are many web architectures relying on this pattern. 

For example, on the server side we have frameworks such as:
 - Spring (Java)
 - Rails (Ruby)
 - Django (Python)
 - Play (Java, Scala)

On the client side (frontend), we have such examples as:
 - AngularJS
 - Backbone
 - EmberJS

# Model

The model is responsible for the data and logic of the application. It contains the business logic independent of the user interface.

Here we define the data and the processes which may be performed upon it. The model may be sub-composed of smaller units defining/describing different domains of data.

# View

A view displays information to the user. Differing views of the same information can be constructed.

# Controller

A controller takes accepts user input. A controller performs commands on the model and views.

Note: There are many real-world examples of the controller containing business logic. I personally prefer "model heavy" implementations, as I believe this facilitates greater re-useability.

# Spring MVC


The Spring framework h has a central front controller based on a `Servlet` called the `DispatcherServlet`
