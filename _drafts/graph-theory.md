Graph Theory

Point are called vertices (1 vertix, 2+ vertices) may also be known as nodes.

Connecting lines are called edges

If the edges only go one way, the graph is called a directed graph

If there are discontinuous segments in the graph, it is a disconnected graph.

Graphs may contain multiple edges which connect to themselves - loops.

We can create new graphs from an existing graph by removing vertices and edges - these are called subgraphs.

The ORDER of a graph is the number of vertices.

The DEGREE of a vertix is the number of edges connected to the vertix.

Graphs which have a single ring of vertices are called cycles. All cycles have the same number of edges and vertices


---

If all vertices are connected to every other vertix, then there are (n * (n - 1))/2 edges, where n is the number of vertices.


Kn = (n * (n -1))/2

----

BIPARTITE graphs are graphs which are split into two groups (or sets). Each vertice in a set is connected to all vertices in the other set, but none in it's own.

If x is the number of vertices in the first set, and y is the number of vertices in the second set - then there are x * y edges.

Kxy = x * y

----

Graphs that can be drawn without overlapping edges are called PLANAR graphs

In a planar graph, the number of areas bounded by edges and vertices are called FACES.

Faces + Vertices = Edges + 1

or

F + V = E + 1
